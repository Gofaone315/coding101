##Lyrics

this is coding 101 (mhm)
this is coding 101 (okay)
this is coding 101 (alright)
it if works
man don't touch it

this is coding 101
if it works
man don't touch it
you got an error on line 101
but my code only has 15 lines
oh man it's 404
what it's not found
knowing how to write hello world
in my programming language
makes me the best programmer
of all time man
HTML is a programming language
say no I smell an imposter
oh man I code past hour
your code is our code
my code is my code
copy and paste
that's how we define a programmer
we have no life
but we make sure our clients
have the best life
frontend looks nice
well wait until you see the backend
don't know how to explain
what your code does
then call it an algorithm
